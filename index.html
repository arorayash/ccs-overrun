								<h3>
									<br>
									<br>
									For us, design drives the Vision, setting up the perspective on any new project and the infinite iterations to make it better.
									<br>
									Best designs are effortlessly comprehended and kids are the best judges when it comes to it. Design a touchscreen interface for an Automatic Teller Machine (ATM) geared towards kids aged 10-15 whose parents have opened a savings account for them. These ATMs will be located in public places, such as at malls. They can be used to encourage kids to save money.
									<br>
									<br>
									We'll be delighted to go through your behance/dribbble profile if you have set up any. Please drop the link.

								We all have that one friend with 8.99 points. That really hurts. Every semester, he/she calculates the GPA required for him to get a nine pointer and misses it by one point. And he is not the only one who calculates this GPA every sem.
								<br>
								Now, he would really like something to automate this task for him. Help him by creating an app for the same in your preferred platform of choice. If you are worrying about getting current cgpa and classes and other stuff, feel free to use the awesome VIT academics API. Make an app and get a chance to get selected in our tech team and you might also get to join the creaters of VITacademics.
								<br>
								<br>
								Note : For iOS and android app, an appetize.io link would be preferred over an github repo link.

									<h3>You must have heard of our event Fork The Code aka FTC. It's a treasure hunt kind of event conducted by us, where the participants are given a mobile app very much like Pokemon GO and you travel all around VIT, hunting for clues given by the said app.
										<br>
										<br>
										With all our tech work focused on making the app and the complementing backend for it, we have neglected to make a site for it.
										<br>
										Help us by making an simple website for it to showcase the event? To get more details about the event, you can see its fb page. For a sample site, check out csivit.com/uth, a site for another event of ours.

										Make an awesome and responsive site for a chance to get it featured on our webpage and join our web team.</h3>

								Say whatever about VIT, we really like the way they have computerized everything. From FFCS to Room Allotment to VTOP to Fine Collection :P, all the stuff is pretty fast in here.
								<br> Although, one thing we think they can improve upon is the collection of luggage during room shifting. That process is painstakingly slow and can easily be rectified via an web app.
								<br>
								You must have had some of these experiences, take a printout of the form, get all luggage calculated, get all your mobile number of friends and carry that small slip all throughout the vacation, etc. Imagine filling all this details beforehand on a website, getting your storing location from that site and just going there with your mobile and luggage and yeah id card, almost forgot. It will also make things much easier for VIT management because they will have full knowledge of amount of stuff which needs to stored beforehand and they don't have maintain all those hefty ledgers.
								<br>
								Think you are up for it? Then get started! If its good, you will get a seat in our web team and maybe VIT might even use your system next sem.
								<br>
								<br>
								Note : An docker image would be preferred over a github repo.
